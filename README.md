# The-Guessing-Game-
This is a fun guessing game. Where a random number is selected by the code and you have to guess it in minimum no. of guesses.
It uses the random library to select a random no. from 1 to 100. And the player has to guess the number. The game hints the player
after every guess if the player is 'Warmer' i.e closer  to the guess or 'Colder' i.e the player is further from the guess.
